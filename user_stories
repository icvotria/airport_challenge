As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
    1. In plane_spec.rb, made a test to check that a Plane class object responds to method land.
      1.1 Added land method to Plane class.

I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
    2. In plane_spec.rb, made a test to check that a Plane class
    object responds to method take_off
      2.1 Added take_off method to Plane class
    3. In airport_spec.rb, made a test to check that an Airport class
    object responds to method confirm_takeoff
      3.1 Added confirm_takeoff method to Airport class

I want to prevent landing when the airport is full
    4. In airport_spec.rb, made a test to check for error message
    when a plane tries to land in a full airport
    [first time I didn't have 100% coverage - created an Airport object inside the describe Airport block to fix. First time there were several error messages to work through i.e. expected 0 args, got 1, NameError, NoMethodError - worked through them to get to desired error, nothing was raised]
      4.1 Created land method in Airport class which accepts 1 argument
      4.2 Added guard clause to Airport method land(plane) to raise error if full?
      4.3 Set Airport method land? to return true
      [making sure to solve the problem as simply as I can - very hard to keep yourself on track with that!]
    6. I updated the Airport class method full? to reflect the newly created capacity method
      6.1 Initialized an empty planes array in Airport class to hold planes
      6.2 Changed full? from false to return true only when the size of the planes array is equal or greater than the capacity
      6.3 I amended the raise error if plane tries to land in a full airport test to land enough planes at the airport to reach capacity
      6.3 I amended the Airport method land(plane) to push plane into the planes array, after the guard clause

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
    5. Created a test to check that Airport has a default capacity
      5.1 Added a DEFAULT_CAPACITY constant to Airport class and set it to an arbitrary value of 10
      5.2 Added capacity attribute using attr_reader, and initialised it to set its initial value to equal DEFAULT_CAPACITY
